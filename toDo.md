# To-Do list

- [ ] Figure out a replacement for coping from local to hadoop other than `hadoop dfs -put` command. It is apparently deprecated. 
- [ ] Now using `py34` conda environment to make sure the same version of python is running on master and nodes, however, this is yet to be checked if the whole notebook works properly. Need to check the versions of python on all nodes. 
- [ ] Test Amazon (e.g. ssh to notebook) on Windows
- [ ] Check Google colab
